pre-requisite: linux sysrem required . Did not tested on windows

For Server:

2. After install all packages.Simply type command 'npm start'.
   this will run server on localhost:5000. Keep this running.

For client:
1. Open terminal and write command 'npm install'
2. After install all packages.Simply type command 'npm run dev'.
   this will run server on localhost:3000.
3. Open any browser and go to 'http://localhost:3000'. [this may take some 	   time to load only for the first time].

N.B: client server may seem a bit slow for the first time.As it is not a  optimized build for production.
